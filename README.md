# LiveViewScheduler

This repo shows an example of a LiveView form for displaying, adding and deleting interview availabilities. Please read my [blog post](https://medium.com/@karoline.lende/44b17d522599) for further details.

To start your Phoenix server:

- Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
- Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
- Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

You need to manually create an interview stage e.g. using Postico. Once this is done, you can visit [`localhost:4000/1`](http://localhost:4000/1) from your browser to access the form.
